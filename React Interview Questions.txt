“Yes, package.json lists the dependencies required for the project,
 while package-lock.json records the exact versions that were actually installed.”
 
 Yes 👍 exactly! Both import and require are used to load modules/packages into your JavaScript code.
 require → CommonJS way (older style, used in Node.js).

const fs = require('fs');  // load file system module


import → ES6 modern way (used in React and modern JS).

import React from 'react';  // load React
import axios from 'axios';  // load axios

Great question 👍 Let me explain in very simple words:

The CSS Box Model is how the browser calculates the space an element takes on a webpage.

Every element is like a box made of 4 parts:

Content → the actual text, image, or data inside.

Padding → space between the content and the border (like cushioning).

Border → the line around the element.

Margin → space outside the border (distance from other elements).

Example :
🧮 Formula

Total Width (length)

width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin


Total Height (breadth)

height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin


In React, <></> is called a Fragment (short syntax).

📌 What is a Fragment?

A way to group multiple elements without adding an extra <div> to the DOM.

✅ In short:

Use <></> → for simple grouping.

Use <React.Fragment> → when you need to add attributes like key.

examples:
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Description</p>
  </>
);

return (
  <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
    <h1>{item.title}</h1>
    <p>{item.desc}</p>
  </React.Fragment>
);


✅ Interview short answer:
“React uses the Virtual DOM to calculate changes efficiently. 
When state or props change, React updates the Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous one, 
and only the differences are applied to the actual DOM.”

Yes 👍

Angular → It is a full-fledged framework (developed by Google).

Provides everything out of the box: routing, forms, state management, HTTP services, dependency injection, etc.

Opinionated: you follow Angular’s way of doing things.

React → It is a JavaScript library (developed by Meta/Facebook).

Mainly focuses on building UI components.

For routing, state management, API handling, etc., you need to add third-party libraries (like React Router, Redux, Axios).

More flexible, less opinionated.

👉 So the main difference: Angular = framework (all-in-one), React = library (UI-focused, add what you need).



Styled COmponnets 
✅ Why it’s powerful

No conflicts → You don’t worry about two components using the same CSS class name.

Component-specific → Styles are tied to the component itself.

Maintainable → You don’t end up with one huge global CSS file.
Dynamic Styling with Props


Examole:import React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

// Define styled component
const Button = styled.button`
  background: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "black" : "green")};
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: block;

  &:hover {
    background: blue;
  }
`;

// Use it in the same file
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Normal Button</Button>
      <Button primary>Primary Button</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


display:different scenarios

block → full width, new line, respects width/height.

inline → sits inline, ignores width/height.

inline-block → sits inline but respects width/height.

Do you mean Babel (with one "b")?

👉 Babel is a JavaScript compiler mainly used in React and modern web development.
It converts modern JavaScript (ES6+ features) into older versions of JavaScript that can run in all browsers.


Why we need key
We need a key in React so that React can uniquely identify each list item. 
This helps React know which items changed, were added, or removed, and update only 
those instead of re-rendering the whole list.”
