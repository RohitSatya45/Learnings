1.Redux we have four different components.
1.React component(normal).
2.Store component - where all the state values are stored.
3.Reducer Component - throught reducer we interact with store and  access state values in our react component.
4.Action Creators -through wich we modify state values. it will create action and dispatches to the reducer with 
help of redux-thunk.
