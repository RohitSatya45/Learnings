 Aem is used to store and build the content but it doesn't have fetaure to server content so
 
 we need webserver apachae is the one but when request comes to apache it doesn't know how to fetch content
 and serve to end user then disp  ome sin to play it is  amodule from aem store in apache tells how to fetch
 and show to end user.
 
 
 Disp is a module in webserver it tells apache webserver how to react to requests
 
 1.httpd.conf this is starting point of webserver(apache)
 2.dispatcher.any where dispatcher configurations lies.
 
 so as per adobe to manage large application we make individual folders
httpd.conf
├── dispatcher_vhost.conf
│   └── conf.d (apache config)
│       ├── vhost
│       ├── Rewrite rules
│       ├── variables
│       └── whitelist
└── dispatcher.any
    └── conf.dispatcher.d(dispatcher config)
        ├── farms
        ├── cache
        ├── filters
        ├── renders
        └── virtualhost
		
if we have multiple website we use .vshot for each individual and call dispatcher.any individuall.


Example:
🔹 Apache + Dispatcher job

Think of Apache server as a big hotel 🏨.

That one hotel can have many rooms (websites).

Each website has its own entrance rules.
🔹 Why dispatcher_vhost.conf?

Apache needs to know which website a visitor wants.

Example:
If someone types site1.com, they should go to Website 1.
If someone types site2.com, they should go to Website 2.
This matching is done by VirtualHosts (dispatcher_vhost.conf).
So yes 👉 one Apache server can host multiple websites by using multiple dispatcher_vhost.conf files.

Apache (hotel)
 ├── site1.com → dispatcher_vhost1.conf → dispatcher1.any (rules)
 └── site2.com → dispatcher_vhost2.conf → dispatcher2.any (rules)


2.dispatcher flush agentsetup in AEM:
Note** we can have dispatcher flush agent on publish so that whenver new changes are published then 
dispplush activate.
